# _*cslabs*_: Competence improvement project C#/SF

## Introduction

This is a collection of small pieces of work used for training and
competence improvement for skills needed for *Microsoft's cloud-based
micro-services technology* called _**ServiceFabric**_.

It's very technology biased towards certain areas, as *Microsoft* being what
they are. Hence the focus upon Tools & technology used by the "trade"
_**enterprise-IT**_ (_**C#**_, _**VisualStudio**_, _**.NET**_) and whatever
follows in it's back-waters.

## How and what

Project is heavily based on <u>learning by doing in lab- or
tutorial-form</u>.

As I'm senior (since 1987 as professional and yet some years as student and
passionate nobbiest), I firmly believe having seen and done most things
*worth doing*. I'm skipping books and other formal training where I can
nowadays. *(Actually come to think of it, I always have as I started
very young and curious in a computer era where knowledge was scarce. I'm
i.e. in most parts an autodidact)*

Formal books and training are in many cases too slow, especially when it
mainly regards catching-up. This way I can use my experience and previous
knowledges and fill-up the gaps. Hopefully this way will be faster.
However, I still need to keep very focused. I.e. one skill at a time is
targeted or the out-come will be only fluff and a waste of time. **My way**
<sub>*(TM)*</sub> may not be for everyone.

*(Truth be told, I'm also quite prejudiced against especially Microsoft
training. It's often **way** too bloated, yet discuised in
a seemingly academic fashion.)*

I like documenting what I do and am a firm believer of openness having spent
many years in the service of *Open-/Free-Source*. **Quality**, **facts**,
**science** are my personal guiding-stars (or as I like to see it, just plain
and simple *truth*).

But *best practice* will do in the absence of other...

As this project is primarily for my own needs, documentation may be quite
thin here-and-there. You are of-course welcome to contribute with comments.
This is however **not** and never will be a *product* focused project.

## Fluff

More reading for the anal*ytically* minded follows:

I learned OOP very (Object Pascal & C++) and eventually got quite
skilled in *C++* but abandoned it some 5-10 years down my professional
career.  Basically for the same reasons as Linus Torvald's: It's hard to
become any good at *something* of you focus on *anything*.

Also: *"If C is like giving a man a rifle, C++ is like giving a child bazooka."*

However far as OOP go, C# is quite decent. In some other IT shape-up projects, I
re-write some old code from memory and it turns out that I'm on average
8-times faster writing the same code in C# (which I know almost nothing
about), than in C++. As the code was originally written in C++ I find this
quite remarkable. It ethers says something about C++ or C#, I'm not sure
which yet...


### (Relevant) background skills

This project is my personal training study and training playground. It
doesn't really reflect who I am nor my overall competence, rather what is
needed to be up and running for the trade mentioned above, i.e. _**Microsoft
cloud-based enterprise-IT**_.

*That being said:* If you have a similar back-ground, this project may be of
some interest to you too.

Project is very targeted and narrow filling very personal
white-/gray-spots in my competence-map. Here's an overview of where I stood
starting which may be of help when following my work (i.e. what I skip and
what I emphasize on).

- [ ] Deeply Embedded *(micros & HW, i.e. silicon level)*
- [ ] Mildly Embedded *(for example: phones WRT middleware and system)*
- [ ] Operating systems technology *(I.e. actually doing it, not only using
      it)*
  - [ ] Kernels *(from **bare-on-the-silicon** to Linux)*
  - [ ] Device drivers *(for all the above)*
- [ ] Real-Time: from kernel-implementation to application
- [ ] System engineering *(for all the above)*
- [ ] From way back: C++ and OOP *(<b>very</b> way back)*
- [ ] Formally *very* biased towards UNIX-based tools & UNIX traditional
      way of work.

### Other projects of mine in a similar spirit

Other on-going projects in a similar spirit targeting the same as this
technologies but with somewhat more serious and targeted and where
end-result is _**actually**_ supposed to do something.

* [Polygons in C#](https://github.com/mambrus/polycons_cxx) -
  Linear Algebra transformation and projection of graphical entities.
  (**NOTE:** This is not a 3D rendering-engine. Even if finished it will be
  something completely different.)

* [Polygons in C++ Transparency/portability focused](https://github.com/mambrus/polycons_cxx) -
  Shadow-project of the above with emphasis on doing it the **right way**
  (i.e. UNIX tradition). Build-environment is <b>**CMake**</b> to cover
  everything **including** the odd-bird in the gang: *Windows*.

* [Polygons in C++ (Visual Studio)](https://github.com/mambrus/polygons_cxx_vs) -
  Ditto but exclusively using Visual Studio with all it's whistles and pipes and
  *productivity boosting* (TM) helpers.

* [Polygons in C++ (Visual Studio)](https://github.com/mambrus/polygons_cxx_dotnet) -
  Ditto but *.NET* based Microsoft's CLI interchangeability (In plan, not started
  yet)
