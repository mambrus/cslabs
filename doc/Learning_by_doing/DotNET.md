# Learning by doing **.NET**

This section is loosely oriented around .NET, not the technique itself
(CLI/CLR), but rather the components provided. Both Microsoft's own, and
other 3'rd party libraries.

## Plan / work

Check-off the list below

## Targeted areas

- [ ] Actors (??)
   - [ ] Theory: C# Actor Model Programming (Carl Hewitt)
   - [ ] "Theory": Microsoft's implementation *(may skip this due to personal prejudice)*
   - [ ] Set-up and run a simple Actor-based application from scratch (NOTE: *non SF*)

*(Plan so far. Probably more to follow...)*
