# Learning by doing

## Plan / work - Overview

C# pure language skill will be primarily target. The order in the check-list
below reflects this somewhat. Same skills will increase in paralell. What's
clearly distinuishable are the following areas however.

* Languages (C#, Typescript/JAvascript, NodeJS)
* Sevice Fabric
* Way of work (Tools, Testing)

Regarding languages, I'll skip all but C# initally, then go directly at
ServiceFabric & Logging. On Tools there will be very little specific focus. The
area is only used for notes as there will brobably be plenty.
